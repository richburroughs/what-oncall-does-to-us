# It was 1996

^ Got a call center job at an ISP and got promoted to sysadmin

---

# Here's your pager

^ My boss got me a pager. I was the only sysadmin, and I was suddenly on-call all of the time for a small number of Linux hosts (5-10)

---

# I was stoked

^ I think I was probably excited about this. Suddenly I had some extra responsibility.

---

# Fast forward to 2016

^ Fast forward 20 years. I'd been on-call for most of that time, in rotations of different sizes. Some as small as 3 people, some as big as 10.
^ For a while I was on a team where our boss divided us up by time slots instead of weeks. I was oncall every evening from 7PM to midnight.

---

# My mental health had deteriorated a lot

^ I started having very bad claustrophobia and had panic attacks when I would board airplanes.
^ The first time I had a debate with myself about asking them to let me off of the plane.
^ I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I also had episodes of depression where I'd be in bed for a week straight.

---

# I'm not saying all of this was from being on-call

^ Other things were happening in my life that contributed to my anxiety and depression.
^ But I also can't imagine that being on-call for most of 20 years helped.

---

# We all have stories

^ Talk to anyone who has been on-call and they can likely tell you about pain they've felt from it.
^ We talk about these things a lot. I've heard stories from a lot of my peers as well.
^ But this is all anecdotal. We all have biases and we're unreliable narrators of our own lives.

---

# Meanwhile... Science

^ Meanwhile there are psychologists who have been studying the effect of being oncall for decades. 
^ Sometimes as people in tech we think we know it all and ignore the work of people in other disciplines.
^ We should learn from them instad.

---

# So let's look at some studies

^ I'm going to share with you a few  psychological studies about being on-call

---

# There are some big caveats

- I am not a mental health practitioner or expert
- I've looked into a small number of studies
- These are individual studies so take them with a grain of salt

^ I'm not an expert
^ I've looked into a small number of studies
^ An individual study is just one data point. They need to be duplicated.

---

# But first, let's talk about sleep

^ Before we get into the oncall studies, let's talk for a moment about sleep

---

![100%](images/ted_talk.png)

^ There was a great Ted talk from 2019 by a sleep scientist named Matt Walker
^ Not specific to on-call but we know on-call can cause sleep deprivation
^ His team did a study where they found people in a sleep deprived group had a 40% learning deficit

---

# Some other things he mentions that can be caused by sleep deprivation

- Heart attacks
- Car crashes
- Immune system deficiency
- Increased risk of cancer

---

# Things to consider when looking at on-call studies

- Many of the studies look at people in other professions
- Some are focused on people who have to be on site
- Some look at "extended work availability"

# "Extended work availability and its relation with start-of-day mood and cortisol (2016)"
